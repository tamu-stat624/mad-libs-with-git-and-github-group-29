Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Anidya,

I am writing to you from a giant spaceship in a far galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a black rocket in february. There are 3 chocolates and biscuits of metal here! In the
Gateway there is a pool full of lemonade. I fall asleep each night on a small bed of
copper and dream of fishing quickly. It feels as though I have lived here for
32 hours. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
fighting on a big boat!!

Best wishes,
Group-29
